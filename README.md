# Merge-sort
1. This program will prompt the user to input the size of the list he/she wishes to sort.
2. Then the program will take number of elements in the list as input.
3. The program will put the elements in an array and divide the array in two halves.
4. Both halves of the array will be sorted individually. 
5. Then the program will take both of the sorted halves and merge them together and put them in an array.
6. The resulting array will be the sorted list.
